Installation
============

Requirements
------------

* Moodle 4.5 LTS or 5.3 LTS.
* PHP supported by your Moodle version.

The area plugins of the suite declare this plugin as a dependency: Moodle asks for it when you install one of them.

From a ZIP file
---------------

1. Download ``local_fieldssuite-<version>.zip`` from the `releases <https://github.com/moodle-fields-suite/local_fieldssuite/releases>`_.
2. Go to *Site administration > Plugins > Install plugins*, upload the ZIP and follow the steps.
3. Finish the upgrade at *Site administration > Notifications*.

From source
-----------

Copy the repository to ``local/fieldssuite`` (``public/local/fieldssuite`` on Moodle 5.1 or later) and visit *Site administration > Notifications*:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/moodle-fields-suite/local_fieldssuite.git public/local/fieldssuite

Languages
---------

The package ships only the English strings. Other languages, including Brazilian Portuguese, come from the Moodle translation tool (AMOS), through the language packs.
